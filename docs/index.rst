Ram pressure is a physical process that a galaxy experiences when it travels through a 
gaseous medium, 
such as the intergalactic medium or the intracluster medium. The gas is stripped from the galaxy, 
which can lead to the formation of a tail of gas and stars. This process is known as ram 
pressure stripping. 

GalaRP leverages the `Gala python package <http://gala.adrian.pw/en/latest/>`_, combined with nonconservative orbit 
integration,
to simulate the larger-scale effects of ram pressure absent hydrodynamical instabilities. Its primary purpose is to 
be an efficient tool for finding optimal setup conditions for hydrodynamical wind-tunnel simulations of ram pressure
stripping.

Development is active on `Github <https://github.com/HSouch/galarp/>`_, and the Authors encourage
updates and suggestions to improve and enhance its functionality.
