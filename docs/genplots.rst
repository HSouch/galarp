General Plotting Routines ``plotting.genplots``
===============================================


3D Animated Plots
-----------------

The key plot generated by ``GalaRP`` for aesthetic purposes is a 3D, interactive figure that leverages ``k3d``. To 
generate this plot, use the following line:

.. code-block:: python

    grp.k3d_plot([orbits], outname="3D_plot.html", duration=120)

**Warning** this has a tendancy to crash Jupyter notebooks if the OrbitContainer has a large number of particles, but
it usually will still successfully return the ``html`` object.


Showing distributions in 3D
---------------------------

To plot the distribution of particles at different points of the simulation, and also check ``GalaRP``'s ability to 
measure the disk size, you can use the ``pyplot_3D_plot``.


.. code-block:: python

    grp.pyplot_3D_plot(orbits, nrows=2, ncols=2, tmin=450, tmax=800, cmap="rainbow", rmax=35)

This will show the distribution of particles, color-coded by vertical velocity, at different snapshots. The snapshots
shown can be controlled with ``nrows``, ``ncols``, ``tmin``, and ``tmax``.
